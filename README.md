# mathrougelike

I had this fantastic idea to mix rougelike with simple math. each time you face an enemy it depends on your math
knowledge how hard you hit the enemy.

# started with jsrogue2

A roguelike game developed in JavaScript, utilizing modern JS features. This project is a reimplementation/fork of the initial rot.js tutorial which is now outdated as of 2013. 
The goal of this project is to make developing a Roguelike in Javascript relatively straightforward for beginners to follow. Each portion of the Roguelike will be created incrementally in separate branches, and each section will slowly help guide you to build your very own Roguelike game.
